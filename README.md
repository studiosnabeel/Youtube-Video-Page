# Youtube-Video-Page
Hey we are going to create some issues
This repository is made for me to complete my pre bootcamp assignment before microverse day1. In this repository i will practice creating youtube video page using HTML
and CSS only.
The idea is to get my hands dirty with all the knowledge that i have at the moment to create youtube page. The page does not have to be perfect. Mainly i have to 
embed a youtube video in my HTML along with suggestion videos on one side and also create an input form for commments etc etc.....
